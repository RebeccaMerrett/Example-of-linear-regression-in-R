#I noticed I could not get Rsquared on testset when included missing values.<br>
airquality <- na.exclude(airquality)<br>
#na.exclude leaves out rows with missing values, but keeps track of where they were so that when making predictions a vector will be the same length of the actual response.<br>
#Use scatterplot matrix to find correlations between variables. Ozone on y axis has strong positive correlation with Temp on x axis.<br>

#lm plot of predictor along x horizontal axis and response (what want to predict) along y vertical axis.<br>
#The regression line will go with the best fit to the data, with grey band around it meaning uncertainty in fit.<br>
#This is to first see if data is in any way suitable to be fitted in linear form.
